This is the code of paper "Identifying common and specific regulatory modules between miRNAs and genes for cancer subtyping by a high-order graph matching model".

"do_simulated_experiment.m" is the main code with the noise experiments "do_experiment_with_noise.m". "do_experiment_with_noise.m" is the experiment about the effects of different noise.

"Generate_dataset.m" is our synthetic data generated with different noise and missing-value rate.

In addition, "do_HOGMCS.m" is the code of our HOGMCS algorithm.
